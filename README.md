Matlab code for spike sorting written by Felix Franke, ETH Zürich

The documentation in "documentation.pdf" is VERY outdated.

New documentation coming soon.

Also parts of the project are still missing, so not all the functions (especially some for plotting) will work.

Please use at own risk.


Som old parts of this code were developed during my PhD in the group of Klaus Obermayer, TU-Berlin but most of the code is new.

See my PhD thesis for some theory about spike sorting:
